#FILE DESCRIPTIONS
------------------

Filename: DSAProgram#2.cpp

This project loads data from an input file given by the user and creates a linked list of pointers to data objects. Each object consists of three string fields for storing last name, first name, and ssn. The program sorts the list after it is created. Data items are sorted by last name. Data items with identical last names are sorted based on first names. If first and last names are identical, data items are sorted based on ssn. The output of the program is a sorted list that is written to a file designated by the user.
